Hi, everyone! Here is Wenyi Shi. A 23-year-old girl who is about to enter the society. You are VERY welcome to come to my homepage to learn about my previous achievements. In addition to my academic achievements, I also have a warm and friendly personality that makes me a pleasure to be around. I am also a natural leader who inspires others with my positivity and can-do attitude. I have a strong sense of empathy and is always willing to lend a listening ear to those in need. :)
